## Coding Quiz App
A brief coding quiz written almost entirely through Java

# about
The project started as a simple coding quiz but sought to a lot of functionality that served as practice and experience in manipulating the DOM dynamically through JavaScript as well as maintaining a user's status as they work through the quiz and stored history with the app. 

While I did not focus on general aesthetics, there are a lot of minor quality of life features such as a long-term scoreboard, visible timer, and built in feedback for answers that also allows for a smoother transition between questions.
